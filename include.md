### Very welcome to the most dangerous phenomena in USA viewer

This small application comes from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

This dataset has been got from [the Coursera Reproducible Research Course site](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and was processed as it was asked for in the course's peer assignment.

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/agomariz/DevelopingDataProducts).

The application is quite easy. There are two panel. In both of them you can adjust the time range and event types that are interesting  for you using control panel located on the left side. Once you have chosen your dates and events, in ***By states:*** panel, you can see how the different states were affected. On the other hand, in ***By years:*** panel, you can see how was the impact for the different events in the years within the selected time interval.
